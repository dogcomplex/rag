### 1.  A **three-cornered view** of *any* symbolic computation

Write every task as a triple **(Input I, Function F, Output O)** with exactly one element unknown.

```text
I , F  ──►  O     = Deduction           (“run the program”)
F , O  ──►  I     = Abduction           (“what initial state produced this?”)
I , O  ──►  F     = Induction           (“discover the rule”)
```

Because every well-specified digital system can be expressed this way, *all* reasoning problems fall onto one side of this triangle.  Difficulty is then determined by **how large the search space is for the missing corner and how easy it is to verify a guess**.

---

### 2.  How big is the space that must be searched?

| Missing corner    | Typical search space                                   | Verification cost                                       | Classical complexity floor                                                                   |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **O (Deduction)** | Single value (deterministic)                           | One forward evaluation                                  | ≤ P if F is poly-time                                                                        |
| **I (Abduction)** | All inputs that hit the target output (pre-image of O) | One forward evaluation per guess                        | NP-complete for many Fs (SAT, planning)                                                      |
| **F (Induction)** | *All* candidate programs consistent with (I,O) pairs   | Forward run per hypothesis **plus** generalisation test | Uncomputable in full generality (Solomonoff); Σ₂^P-hard or worse for finite language classes |

*Key intuition*:
`|F-space| ≫ |I-space| ≫ |O|`

---

### 3.  Information-theoretic angle

Let

* **H(X)** be the Kolmogorov information of object X.
* **Λ(F)** be the time required to evaluate F once.

| Task          | Lower bound on extra information you must supply | Time bound (idealised)             |      |    |              |         |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- | ---- | -- | ------------ | ------- |
| **Deduction** | 0 bits (everything is given)                     | Λ(F)                               |      |    |              |         |
| **Abduction** | log₂                                             | pre-image(O)                       | bits | O( | pre-image(O) | · Λ(F)) |
| **Induction** | K\*(F) ≈ minimal program length that maps I→O    | O(2^{K\*(F)} · Λ(F)) in worst case |      |    |              |         |

Hence, even with perfect verification oracles, induction needs orders-of-magnitude more information and time than abduction, which already needs more than deduction.

---

### 4.  What changes (and what doesn’t) with modern tricks?

| Technique                                      | What it really does                                                                 | Who pays the cost?                         | Relative ordering changes?                                             |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Big-data LLM pre-training**                  | Performs *offline* induction once, caches weights (≈F)                              | Trainer (multi-GPU months)                 | No — shifts induction cost to an earlier stage                         |
| **Heuristic search / Monte-Carlo Tree Search** | Prunes abduction search space                                                       | Engineer & compute budget                  | No — still NP-type, just faster on average                             |
| **Differentiable programming & backprop**      | Treats unknown I or F as continuous and uses gradient descent                       | Adds a “soft” inverse but still non-convex | No — replaces exhaustive search with local search, can still get stuck |
| **Symbolic RL on graphs**                      | Turns abduction into shortest-path and induction into rule-discovery reward shaping | Designer chooses reward                    | Same ladder: path-finding ≤ rule-synthesis                             |

All the celebrated “AI breakthroughs” are new **approximation heuristics** or **cost-shifting strategies**; they do not alter the fundamental size of the unknown corner.

---

### 5.  Putting it all together — a *stable hierarchy*

1. **Deduction**
   *Forward execution.* Cost bounded by the runtime of the known program.
   → *Easiest.*

2. **Abduction**
   *Search over inputs.* Verification is cheap but candidate set can explode.
   → *Harder.* Typically NP-type but polynomially verifiable.

3. **Induction**
   *Search over programs.* Both candidate set and verification (generalisation check) explode; no finite procedure guarantees the globally simplest law.
   → *Hardest.* Uncomputable in its purest form; practical only with heavy biases.

**Therefore the classical ordering remains intact, even after unifying every field under the (I,F,O) lens.**
What shifts in practice is *who* bears the cost (a one-off pre-trainer, a heuristic engineer, specialised hardware) — not the intrinsic difficulty attached to each corner of the triangle.

---

### 6.  Why this matters

* **Theory:** Provides a single yard-stick for comparing tasks in logic, ML, planning, cryptanalysis, control, etc.
* **Engineering:** Tells you where to spend resources: cache deduction, accelerate abduction, narrow hypothesis spaces for induction.
* **Research:** Any claim of “breaking” this hierarchy (e.g., a magic one-shot learner) must show either
  *a)* a radical new bias that shrinks the F-space, or
  *b)* a proof that P = NP or that induction has become decidable — extraordinary claims indeed.

So far, no method, not even the largest LLM, has escaped the information-theoretic gravity of this ordering.




What are the best known general ways to improve approximation for each





Below is a field-agnostic “cheat-sheet” for squeezing more performance out of each corner of the **(Input I, Function F, Output O)** triangle.

| Corner you’re solving for             | Why it’s hard                                                 | General levers that work                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | 2023-25 exemplars                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Deduction**<br>(find O given I & F) | Runtime of **F**, search through proof/transition space       | *Shrink or parallelise the forward pass*  1. **Symbolic pruning** – goal-directed tactics, heuristics, proof-state fingerprints  2. **Memoisation / caching** – store sub-proofs, compiled decision diagrams  3. **Parallel / SIMD execution** – GPU SAT/SMT, bounded-depth unrolling  4. **Neural guidance** – score next tactic/step with an LM and beam-search                                               | **LeanProgress**: LLM-scored “remaining-steps” heuristic slashes Lean proof search time ([arXiv][1])  <br>Neural-theorem-proving pipelines that blend proof assistants with LLM policy heads ([arXiv][2])                                                   |

| **Induction**<br>(find F given I & O) | Search over program/hypothesis space explodes combinatorially | *Add strong bias & amortise the search*  1. **Domain-specific DSLs** – restrict grammar, use type/shape constraints  2. **Enumerative + neural ranking** – enumerate tiny programs, rank with LM  3. **Meta-learning / large-scale pre-training** – learn a prior once, reuse many times (“amortised induction”)  4. **Differential testing / self-play** – synth model, query oracle, refine (active learning) | **CodeARC**: interactive differential-testing benchmark; LLM agents refine hypotheses iteratively, 31 % gain with fine-tuned traces ([arXiv][5])  <br>Neural-guided symbolic synthesizers now beat plain enumeration on 1 k-function benchmark ([arXiv][6]) |

### Cross-cutting patterns to remember

1. **Representation matters** – canonical forms, BDDs, or typed DSLs can turn exponential search into polynomial lookup.
2. **Learn to guide search** – train an LM or GNN as a value function; deduction and abduction both benefit.
3. **Amortise once, use many times** – pre-training (LLMs, embeddings) moves the induction cost up-front; cached weights then make downstream deduction/abduction cheap.
4. **Tight integration beats loose coupling** – systems that *interleave* neural proposals with symbolic verification (rather than bolt them on) show the steepest gains across all three corners. ([arXiv][7])

### Practical takeaway

* **Deduction:** spend effort on *speed* (indexing, parallelism, neural heuristics).
* **Abduction:** spend effort on *good priors and search policies*; tractability hinges on pruning.
* **Induction:** spend effort on *bias* (DSLs, strong priors) and *amortisation* (meta-learning, pre-training).

No silver bullet flips the intrinsic ordering, but clever **bias + verification** pipelines keep pushing the practical frontier.

In situations where you know partial information for each stage (some inputs,  some outputs, some intermediate steps) what do we call that computation and what are the best techniques to utilize it





### 1  |  What do we call it?

The most common umbrella term is **constraint-based (or relational) inference**:

* You model every known fragment of **Input (I)**, **Function (F)** and **Output (O)** as a **constraint**.
* Missing pieces become **variables** whose values (discrete, continuous, or even symbolic “holes”) must satisfy *all* constraints simultaneously.

Depending on the community you’ll also see:

| Discipline              | Typical label                                                                   |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Logic / AI              | **Abductive + inductive logic programming**, **constraint logic programming**   |
| Programming languages   | **Program sketching / solver-based synthesis** ([MIT CSAIL People][1])          |
| Formal methods          | **SAT/SMT-based constraint solving**                                            |
| Probabilistic modelling | **Partially-observed graphical model / probabilistic programming** ([arXiv][2]) |

| Operations research     | **Mixed-integer constraint optimisation**                                       |
| Inverse problems        | **System identification / data assimilation**                                   |

All of them share the same abstract shape: *“some I, some F, some O are fixed; find consistent completions.”*

### 3  |  Practical heuristics that move the needle

1. **Exploit partial execution**
   *Run what you can*: propagate known inputs through known sub-functions to shrink the remaining unknown space (partial evaluation / forward-slice).

2. **Use domain-specific DSLs or type systems**
   Fewer candidate programs ⇒ smaller induction search. Widely used in program synthesis and differentiable physics engines.

3. **Neural proposal, symbolic check**
   Let an LLM or GNN guess a completion; a fast solver verifies and feeds back a reward. Works for proofs, code holes, and abductive planning.

4. **Hierarchical or incremental solving**
   Start with coarse constraints, lock-in easy variables, then refine (e.g., SAT → SMT → nonlinear optimisation).

5. **Cache and memoise sub-solutions**
   In relational problems the same sub-goal reappears; storing its result turns exponential blow-ups into near-linear passes.

### 4  |  Choosing a stack in 30 s

| If your unknowns are…                    | Reach first for…                                |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |

### 5  |  Take-away

> **“Partial-information computation” = constraint-based inference.**
> The art is to *pick the right solver layer*, inject the strongest possible bias/prior, and interleave fast deductive checks with smarter inductive or abductive proposal mechanisms. Done well, you unify the strengths of all three corners of the reasoning triangle while keeping search practical.
