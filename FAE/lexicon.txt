nice first pass.  lets explore various options and look for a nice elegant fit for all of them

Definitely leaning hard towards use of the moon.
Many are conflicting or not self-consistent, as I'm considering a few different candidate layers...  e.g. fire, sun, moon all different themes that may or may not work
Overlaps are often that same ambiguity, or playing with multiple differ concept options.
| indicates the middle one covers both upper and lower symbols (though they may lean a certain way)
Roughly leftmost are typically preferred/best, but still working out opinions here

These are mostly describing people/identities within this system, a lot of these might be signs that they refer to themselves by, or that others refer to them with derogatorily.

Care to chime in on the overall theme/direction here?  Can you help articulate the different choices in themes still present which need to be worked out?
