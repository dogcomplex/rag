These are derived from mythological history, with some obvious fudge factoring but generally fair to the gradient between order and chaos - which were big factors in the development of the mythologies.

Our lexicon.txt using Hallowed <=> Blighted is very similar to this, except the Sun and Moon are swapped currently.  This might be wrong, if we're trying to match historical mythologies.

Possible re-analysis:  craft, forge, tool use, magic, writing, agriculture, fertility, and aphrodite might be between Earth and Sky (ORDER).  If so that's moon, and perhaps even sun since it was seen as a holy order

And then below Earth above Chaos would be the province of Warfare, Storms, and natural events that are chaotic in nature but still part of the natural order.  Trickster gods likely here too.
