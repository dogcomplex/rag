Corrective RAG (CRAG)¶
Corrective-RAG (CRAG) is a strategy for RAG that incorporates self-reflection / self-grading on retrieved documents.

In the paper here, a few steps are taken:

If at least one document exceeds the threshold for relevance, then it proceeds to generation
Before generation, it performs knowledge refinement
This partitions the document into "knowledge strips"
It grades each strip, and filters our irrelevant ones
If all documents fall below the relevance threshold or if the grader is unsure, then the framework seeks an additional datasource
It will use web search to supplement retrieval
We will implement some of these ideas from scratch using LangGraph:

Let's skip the knowledge refinement phase as a first pass. This can be added back as a node, if desired.
If any documents are irrelevant, let's opt to supplement retrieval with web search.
We'll use Tavily Search for web search.
Let's use query re-writing to optimize the query for web search.

LLMs¶
Using Pydantic with LangChain

This notebook uses Pydantic v2 BaseModel, which requires langchain-core >= 0.3. Using langchain-core < 0.3 will result in errors due to mixing of Pydantic v1 and v2 BaseModels.

The design of generative agents combines LLM with memory, planning, and reflection mechanisms to enable agents to behave conditioned on past experience. Memory stream is a long-term memory module that records a comprehensive list of agents' experience in natural language. Short-term memory is utilized for in-context learning, while long-term memory allows agents to retain and recall information over extended periods.

Thought for 1m 16s

Here’s a crisp compare-and-integrate pass: what CorrectiveRAG (CRAG) adds on top of “plain” GraphRAG, and exactly how to fold those ideas into our Windows/LM-Studio starter.

What CRAG is (in one paragraph)

CRAG adds a lightweight retrieval evaluator that self-grades the initial context, then routes the query through one of three actions: Correct (keep and refine), Incorrect (discard and expand with external search), or Ambiguous (combine both). On “Correct,” it decomposes documents into fine-grained “knowledge strips,” grades strips, filters, and recomposes. On “Incorrect,” it rewrites the query and brings in web search results (then also strips/filters). Ablations show each piece helps; a small T5-based evaluator outperformed ChatGPT for relevance grading, and the method boosts both vanilla RAG and Self-RAG across short/long-form tasks with modest overhead. 

2401.15884v3

GraphRAG vs. CRAG (high-level)
Dimension	Our GraphRAG starter	CRAG additions (what we should borrow)
Global structure	Entity co-occurrence graph + Louvain communities; hybrid dense+BM25; community summaries	Not graph-centric; per-query quality control gate on retrieved chunks
Quality control	None yet (just hybrid merge)	Self-grading evaluator → route to Correct / Incorrect / Ambiguous
Granularity	Chunk-level	Strip-level refinement (sentence/mini-span filtering) before generation
Fallbacks	Expand k; walk graph neighbors (planned)	Web search (with query rewrite), then same refinement
Overhead	Low	Small extra pass (grader + strip scoring); paper shows modest cost for clear gains 

2401.15884v3


Robustness	Sensitive to bad chunks	Designed to be robust to bad retrieval; ablations confirm each action helps 

2401.15884v3

Integration plan for our starter (minimal moving parts)
1) Add a local Relevance Grader (no fine-tuning required to start)

Use a fast cross-encoder as a plug-in scorer (local, GPU): e.g., cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2 (very fast) or BAAI/bge-reranker-base (higher quality). Both run via sentence-transformers we already ship.

Score each (question, chunk_text) → scalar in [0,1] (normalize if model outputs logits).

Config (new, in .knowledge/config/models.yml):

crag:
  enabled: true
  grader_model: cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2
  upper: 0.60      # ≥ upper ⇒ Correct
  lower: 0.30      # < lower ⇒ Incorrect
  topk_grade: 24   # how many retrieved chunks to grade


Why cross-encoder first? The CRAG paper trains a small T5 evaluator and finds it beats prompting LLMs for grading; a cross-encoder is the closest off-the-shelf analogue that’s local and fast. 

2401.15884v3

2) Implement action policy (Correct / Incorrect / Ambiguous)

After our hybrid retrieval returns N chunks, grade them:

Correct if any grade ≥ upper → keep only graded-relevant chunks and go to refinement.

Incorrect if all < lower → skip internal chunks and go to fallback retrieval (next section).

Ambiguous otherwise → keep best few internal chunks and run fallback; merge.

3) Add strip-level refinement (the “knowledge strips”)

For chunks that survive:

Split each chunk into sentences (or ~150–300 char spans).

Grade each strip with the same grader; keep top m per chunk (e.g., 2–3).

Reassemble in source order.

This mirrors CRAG’s decompose→filter→recompose, which drove gains in ablations. 

2401.15884v3

Config knobs (new in pipeline.yml):

crag_refine:
  strip_chars: 300
  max_strips_per_chunk: 3

4) Add fallback retrieval without breaking “offline-first”

Default (offline) fallback when Incorrect (or Ambiguous):

Expand scope: raise dense k and relax BM25; include graph-neighbor chunks (1–2 hops from any entity in the top few chunks, if any).

Query rewrite (local LLM via LM Studio) to enrich keywords; then re-retrieve internally.

Optional (opt-in) web search module (Tavily/Bing/Serper) if you ever add API keys. Paper prefers authoritative pages (e.g., Wikipedia) then applies the same strip-refine; we’ll mirror that when online is enabled. 

2401.15884v3

Config:

crag_fallback:
  use_web: false         # stays offline by default
  expand_dense_k: 48
  graph_hops: 2
  rewrite_with_llm: true

5) Wire it into our retrieval path (surgical changes)

New module kn/crag.py:

grade_chunks(question, chunks) -> List[(chunk, score)]

decide_action(scores, upper, lower) -> {"Correct"|"Incorrect"|"Ambiguous"}

refine_strips(question, chunks) -> refined_text

fallback_retrieve(question, cfg) -> chunks (expand k, graph hops; optional web)

Modify kn/retrieval.py:answer_query(...):

Do current hybrid retrieval (dense+BM25).

If crag.enabled, call grader → action.

Build final context:

Correct → refine_strips(internal_hits)

Incorrect → refine_strips(fallback_hits)

Ambiguous → refine_strips(internal_top) + refine_strips(fallback_hits)

Prepend our community snippets (unchanged), then hand off to generator or exporter.

Cache: write per-(query_hash, chunk_id) grades to .knowledge/indexes/grades/ to avoid rescoring on repeated queries.

6) Export & safety

Exporter can note the CRAG path taken:

e.g., CRAG: Correct (6 strips kept from 3 chunks); or CRAG: Ambiguous (internal+fallback).

If optional web fallback is enabled, pass those strips through the existing PII plugin before inclusion (paper calls out reliability concerns for web content; we’ll add our own guardrails). 

2401.15884v3

Why this is worth it (evidence from CRAG)

Self-grading matters: Their small evaluator correctly judged retrieval quality far better than ChatGPT in their test (PopQA) and drove consistent gains. 

2401.15884v3

All three actions help: Removing Correct / Incorrect / Ambiguous each hurt performance; the “Ambiguous” middle path mitigates evaluator uncertainty. 

2401.15884v3

Strip-level refinement helps: Dropping refinement, rewrite, or selection each reduced accuracy—so do the decomposition/filter/recompose step, not just bigger k. 

2401.15884v3

Overhead is modest relative to gains; CRAG keeps compute close to RAG in their measurements. 

2401.15884v3

Defaults I’d set for you now

Grader model: cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2 (fastest good baseline; upgrade to BAAI/bge-reranker-base if you want more headroom).

Thresholds: upper=0.60, lower=0.30.

topk to grade: 24 (grade fewer than you retrieve; still plenty to decide and filter).

Strip size ~300 chars, keep 2–3 per chunk.

Fallback: expand dense k to 48, include 1–2 graph hops, rewrite query via local LLM (LM Studio), keep use_web=false.

Where CRAG + GraphRAG complement each other

CRAG gives per-query robustness, GraphRAG gives global structure. Combining them: when Incorrect, instead of jumping straight to the web, we first walk our graph (neighbors & communities) and only go online if you’ve opted in. That keeps us fast, offline, and aligned with your multi-repo setup—while inheriting CRAG’s resilience when initial hits are noisy.

If you want, I can produce the small code patch list (new kn/crag.py, few edits in kn/retrieval.py, and the two config blocks) next.

Could you also incorporate the lessons learned by this paper, if they're replicable to our environment (or explain why not, if not)
ChatGPT said:
Thought for 1m 9s

Absolutely—here’s how we’d fold the key, replicable ideas from “Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning with Lean Language Models” into our GraphRAG starter, plus what isn’t a great fit (and why). I’ll keep this focused on changes you can actually run on your Windows + LM Studio setup.

What to adopt (and where it lands in our repo)
1) Summary-first indexing (big win, easy to add)

Lesson: They index summarized versions of documents (≈85% shorter) and see higher p@k than indexing full pages; then recover full content only when needed. This shrinks context, speeds everything, and improves first-hit relevance. 

2508.11386v1

How we add it

New attribute plugin: plugins/attributes/doc-summary.py that creates a compact per-doc summary (static, offline) into .knowledge/indexes/summaries/doc/.

New “summary index”: build a second HNSW index from summaries alongside the full-chunk index.

Retrieval path: query summary-index → select top docs → rehydrate by pulling either (a) the doc’s best chunks from the full index or (b) the entire doc if you prefer (see next item).

Config (new):

summarize_index:
  enabled: true
  target_ratio: 0.15     # ~85% reduction
  model: ${OPENAI_MODEL} # via LM Studio locally
  use_for_retrieval: true
  rehydrate: full_doc    # or: best_chunks


Why it fits your constraints: offline, uses your local LLM, keeps original files untouched.

2) “Promote to full document” (source rehydration)

Lesson: If any chunk from a doc hits, they feed the whole doc to the reasoner so local context isn’t lost. In our pipeline that’s a controlled “rehydration” step. 

2508.11386v1

How we add it

After we pick top-k summaries, rehydrate either to (a) entire sources or (b) N nearest chunks around those sources.

Export path also respects this, so mono-file includes full supporting text (optionally trimmed).

3) Retrieval as a “tool” (don’t always retrieve)

Lesson: Treat retrieval as callable: the model decides when to retrieve vs. answer directly; also rewrite the query when needed. This matters in chat flows and follow-ups. 

2508.11386v1

How we add it (without fancy tool-calling)

Keep it offline and model-agnostic: add a small “should_retrieve” gate (cross-encoder or logistic classifier over the last user turn + short history). If score < τ, skip retrieval.

If documents look weak (see §5 CRAG below), rewrite the query via local LLM (brief keyword-boosted rewrite) then re-retrieve.

4) CRAG-style self-grading + strip filtering (pairs perfectly)

Lesson: Their results underscore that quality control before generation and fine-grain filtering lift accuracy with small overhead. Combine with our CRAG plan:

Grade retrieved chunks with a local cross-encoder (e.g., ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2) → route to Correct / Incorrect / Ambiguous.

Strip-level refinement: split surviving chunks into 150–300-char strips, grade again, keep only the best few per chunk, and recompose the context. (This mirrors the paper’s “knowledge refinement” benefit.) 

2508.11386v1

Config we’ll ship

crag:
  enabled: true
  grader_model: cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2
  upper: 0.60
  lower: 0.30
  topk_grade: 24
crag_refine:
  strip_chars: 300
  max_strips_per_chunk: 3
crag_fallback:
  use_web: false           # stays offline
  expand_dense_k: 48
  graph_hops: 2
  rewrite_with_llm: true

5) Two-tier retrieval budget (pick k smartly)

Lesson: They explicitly choose k by measuring p@k trade-offs; retrieval of summaries let them run k=5 with manageable context (and ~0.76 upper-bound hit-rate in their domain). 

2508.11386v1

How we add it

Small CLI to log p@k on your corpora (using source-of-truth tags or quick heuristics).

Config preset: k_small=5 for fast passes, auto-bump to k_large=30..50 inside fallback only when needed.

6) Test-time scaling for lean models (no fine-tuning required)

Lesson: They show big gains by combining retrieval with lean reasoning and test-time tricks (self-consistency/majority vote, budget forcing). You want offline + cheap → we use the tricks, skip heavy SFT. 

2508.11386v1

Add self-consistency: do n=3–5 short generations and vote (string-match or cross-encoder evidence score over answers). Gate behind --fast vs --best.

Add “budget forcing” lite: set high max_tokens but cap visible reasoning; instruct the model to keep internal notes concise (we’ll only surface the answer + citations).

7) Conversation assembly that won’t bloat history

Lesson: Put retrieved context in the system message for the current turn vs. appending into history (keeps history small and stable). 

2508.11386v1

How we add it

Our chat runner (optional) will build a new system message per turn with the refined strips + short community preface. History retains only user/assistant turns, not past contexts.

8) Evaluation knobs you’ll appreciate

Lesson: They instrument retrieval p@k and task accuracy to pick k, model size, and summarization ratio; they also tried reranking and query rewriting. We’ll mirror the easy bits. 

2508.11386v1

New CLI: bin/eval_retrieval.py (p@k over a labeled subset).

Optional query rewriter (local LLM) gated by the CRAG decision.

Reranker: leave as optional (they saw mixed results). We already have a cross-encoder on hand; flip on if you want.

What not to copy (and our substitutes)

Frontier-model synthetic data & reasoning-trace SFT
They generate synthetic queries with GPT-4o and distill DeepSeek-R1 reasoning into Qwen2.5-32B via long-context SFT (block size 32k), then deploy that tuned model. Great for research; heavy for a local, offline workflow. We won’t do this by default. Instead we:

Use summary-first + CRAG + strip filtering + self-consistency to emulate much of the gain at inference time.

If you ever want SFT later, we can prepare datasets locally and fine-tune a smaller model (e.g., 7B) as an add-on. 

2508.11386v1

Always retrieving full docs
Works for their NHS domain because pages are bounded and curated. On arbitrary repos, full-doc payloads can explode. We support rehydrate=best_chunks (default) and let you toggle full_doc when files are small. 

2508.11386v1

Query-aware summarization at retrieval time
They note it’s higher quality but slower (an extra LLM step per query). We keep it optional; static summaries are the fast default. 

2508.11386v1

Concrete patch list for our starter

New: plugins/attributes/doc-summary.py (offline summarizer; writes .knowledge/indexes/summaries/doc/<doc_id>.md).

New: kn/summary_index.py (build/read HNSW over summaries).

New: kn/crag.py (grader, action policy, strip refinement, fallback).

Update: kn/retrieval.py

Step 1: search summary index (if enabled).

Step 2: CRAG grade → Correct / Incorrect / Ambiguous.

Step 3: refine strips; on Incorrect/Ambiguous, expand k and walk graph neighbors before any (optional) web fallback.

Step 4: assemble system prompt with refined strips (not appended to history).

New: bin/eval_retrieval.py (reports p@k across a labeled CSV/JSONL).

Config additions: summarize_index, crag, crag_refine, crag_fallback blocks shown above.

Defaults I’d ship (tuned for your box)

Summary ratio 0.15, k_small=8, fallback k_large=48, graph_hops=2.

Grader = ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2, thresholds upper=0.60, lower=0.30.

Strip size 300, keep 3 per chunk.

Self-consistency: off by default; --best enables n=3 votes.

Why these changes are justified

Summary-first + rehydrate improves retrieval and slashes context without losing fidelity; they measured better p@k with summaries than with full pages. 

2508.11386v1

CRAG + strip filtering boosts robustness to bad hits; their ablations and narrative emphasize the value of pre-generation filtering/correction and query rewrite. 

2508.11386v1

Agentic retrieval (only when useful) and system-slot context keep chats snappy and memory-efficient. 

2508.11386v1

Test-time scaling (self-consistency, budget control) is the practical path for lean, local models when SFT isn’t desired. 

2508.11386v1

If you want, I can generate the four new files (summary plugin, summary index, crag module, eval CLI) tailored to the scaffold you already downloaded and wire the config blocks exactly where they go.

so, RAG is nice to have but I want to be able to get as close to being able to ingest a list of every saved post on reddit and feed them into a single AI session in the most information-rich form we can despite compression.  Alternatively if that means segmenting them into multiple sessions and reducing them down with summaries/sorting that might be necessary too.  RAG by itself seems to be criticized as losing the nuance and deeper understanding of the data when digested, so im not sure if that's sufficient.

What is the breadth of other methods available here?  what do we have as tools already and what might we still want to be able to pushthis system as close to a general-purpose one we can simply toss piles of data into ajd trust that it will process it about as well as any known method out there - dynamically picking methods for different data if it needs to, even.
ChatGPT said:
Thought for 40s

You’re right: plain RAG is great for lookup, but it tends to sand off nuance when you’re trying to ingest a whole personal corpus (like every Reddit save) and think across it. Here’s a compact playbook of methods beyond vanilla RAG, what we already have in your starter, and what I’d add so you can “toss piles of data in” and get rich, trustworthy synthesis.

What we already have (good base)

Sidecar ingestion (non-intrusive): incremental hashing, chunking, embeddings (HNSW), BM25, NetworkX graph + Louvain, community summaries, export to big .md.

Enrichment plugins: terse summary, topic tags, PII scan.

CRAG-style robustness (design ready): relevance grader + strip filtering + query rewrite + fallback scope expansion (stays offline).

Summary-first retrieval (design ready): build a summary index to retrieve against; then rehydrate to full content.

What else is on the table (breadth of methods)

Think of these as composable capabilities you can mix per data & question type.

1) Hierarchical / map-reduce summarization (retains nuance)

Why: Single-pass summaries lose rare but important details.

How: Summarize per post → per cluster → global synthesis, keeping quotes & citations (“evidence packs”) at each level. Use chain-of-density style prompts to add detail and “don’t drop facts” instructions.

Where: New bin/hsum_build.py and an attributes/doc-summary.py (long-form) that writes layered summaries; exporter can assemble top-down digests.

2) “Knowledge strips” + selective recomposition (CRAG refinement)

Why: Passages are long; keep only the salient spans tied to the question/theme.

How: Sentence/150–300-char strips → score via a local cross-encoder → keep the top N per doc → recombine in source order.

Where: kn/crag.py with refine_strips(), already planned.

3) Topic discovery & clustering (multi-view navigation)

Why: You’ll have many domains with sparse links; you need lenses.

How: Embed posts, run KMeans/Agglomerative (Windows-friendly), detect keyphrases per cluster, and surface diversity (not just upvoted).

Where: New kn/topics.py → outputs .knowledge/indexes/topics/ + an “index.md” nav. (We can add HDBSCAN later if you want.)

4) Argument/claim mining (preserve positions)

Why: Reddit nuance = claims + counterclaims. Pure summaries blur this.

How: Lightweight claim/stance extraction with a small local model or prompt; store (claim, support, oppose, quotes, links) per post.

Where: Plugin attributes/claims.py → .knowledge/indexes/attributes/claims/.

5) Timeline & event extraction (when posts talk about evolving stuff)

Why: Helps the model reason causally and temporally.

How: Extract timestamps (post time + in-text dates), build event graph; cluster by entity/topic; generate timeline cards.

Where: plugins/attributes/events.py + kn/timeline.py.

6) Contextual compression & dedup (keep signal, drop repeats)

Why: Saved posts often repeat the same ideas.

How: Near-duplicate detection (MinHash/SimHash), MMR/novelty sampling when assembling contexts, “quota per cluster” to keep variety.

Where: kn/dedup.py + novelty sampler in exporter.

7) Long-context & multi-session packing (monofile, but smarter)

Why: Sometimes you do want to “just feed it all in.”

How: Pack by topic buckets, sorted by importance×novelty, then spill into sequenced sessions with a state summary passed between sessions.

Where: Extend exporter with --pack-mode {topic,chronological,claims} and --sessions N.

8) Self-consistency & self-verification (better final answers)

Why: For global synthesis, single-shot reasoning can miss edges.

How: Generate n=3 independent answers (fast local model), vote/rerank via cross-encoder vs. evidence strips; run a verification pass that asks: “Which claims are weak? What’s missing?”

Where: kn/verify.py + flag in query_rag.py --best.

9) Schema induction to a lightweight KB (when structure helps)

Why: Some subdomains want structured queries later.

How: Opportunistically extract entities/relations (“subreddit, author, topic, claim, evidence_url, time”) into Parquet/SQLite—no heavy graph DB needed yet.

Where: kn/struct_extract.py + data/warehouse.sqlite.

10) Dynamic policy engine (pick the right method per query)

Why: Different questions need different pipelines.

How: A tiny orchestrator decides: lookup (RAG) vs synthesize (HSum+strips) vs explore (topics/timeline) vs argument (claims). Uses cheap signals: query intent, hit quality, corpus size.

Where: kn/orchestrator.py + rules in pipeline.yml:

orchestrator:
  rules:
    - if: intent in ["why","compare","nuance"] or scope=="global"
      then: ["hsum", "crag_refine", "verify"]
    - if: intent in ["fact","where","who"] and good_hits
      then: ["rag_basic"]
    - if: intent=="trend" or "timeline"
      then: ["timeline","hsum_cluster"]

Reddit-specific ingest to preserve nuance

Loader: bin/ingest_reddit_saved.py that reads your export/API, normalizes:

post_id, subreddit, author, title, url, flair, score, created_utc, body_md, comments[]

Thread shaping: Build “post + highlighted comments” docs (comments scored by upvotes, diversity, novelty, and author OP replies).

Quote harvesting: Keep top quotes with permalinks; tag with stance if available.

Attribution: Every summary/claim keeps a back-link to source.

How these pieces interplay (a typical end-to-end)

Ingest & normalize Reddit saves → dedup → chunk → embed.

Run doc summaries (long-form) + topic clustering + claims + events.

For global synthesis: Orchestrator picks HSum → CRAG strips → self-consistency → verify; exporter builds an evidence-rich monofile (or multi-session pack).

For specific questions: Orchestrator tries hybrid RAG → CRAG grading; if weak, expands to graph neighbors; if still weak (and you allow), query rewrite + optional web (off by default).

For exploration: Topic index + timeline + quote booklets.

What this buys you (vs RAG-only)

Nuance preserved via quotes/claims/timelines and strip-level selection.

Coverage via hierarchical map-reduce + topic diversity controls.

Robustness via CRAG grading, fallback scope, and self-verification.

Scalability via dedup/novelty sampling and multi-session packing.

Flexibility via the orchestrator (dynamic method selection).

Minimal add-ons to your starter to get there

New modules: kn/topics.py, kn/dedup.py, kn/orchestrator.py, kn/verify.py, kn/summary_index.py, kn/crag.py (we already scoped CRAG), kn/timeline.py, kn/struct_extract.py.

New plugins: attributes/doc-summary.py (long form), attributes/claims.py, attributes/events.py.

New CLI: bin/ingest_reddit_saved.py, bin/hsum_build.py, bin/eval_retrieval.py.

Config blocks: orchestrator, summarize_index, crag*, pack_mode, sessions, dedup.

If you want, I can generate stubs for those modules and wire the orchestrator rules you prefer (e.g., prioritize HSum for “why/compare/nuance,” RAG for “fact/where,” timeline for “when/how over time”), plus a Reddit ingest script that works with your exported JSON.

You said:
Similarly we want this same system to be able to just easily digest:  github repos (readmes at least), twitter dumps, entire subreddits, scientific papers, various .txt writings, signal chats, discord dumps, lists of comfyui node repos, kiwix data dumps, academictorrents dumps, arxiv paper dumps, huggingface model pages, news articles, hackernews,  bluesky, previous chatgpt and gemini conversations, a messy local disk full of files, etc etc - a whole bunch of different sources with varying degrees of truth and trustworthiness.  Ideally we want to be able to have it just churn on these and find the most useful things it can, for various priorities, and index them generally in preparation to start.  How does that menu change things
ChatGPT said:
Thought for 19s

Love that menu. The good news: we don’t need a different “system” — we need a source-adapter layer, trust/utility scoring, and a slightly smarter orchestrator. Your GraphRAG+CRAG starter becomes a general “throw piles of data at it” engine by adding adapters for each dump format, normalizing to a common schema, running enrichment, then letting the orchestrator pick the right workflow per source and query.

Here’s the high-level delta.

1) Architecture changes (small but powerful)

Adapters → Canonical docs. Add sources/* modules that turn each dump (Reddit, GitHub, X/Twitter, PDFs, Kiwix, etc.) into a Doc with the same fields:

doc_id, source_type, source_id, title, text, html_md, url, author, created_at,
metrics{score,stars,retweets,points…}, tags[], provenance[], media[], 
trust_signals{domain_rank?, venue?, arxiv_ver?, ocr_conf?, repo_age…}


Trust & utility scoring. New kn/trust.py computes two numbers per doc:

TrustScore (0–1): source-specific reliability prior.

UtilityScore (0–1): novelty × recency × engagement × length quality.

Priority queue. kn/prioritizer.py orders work: cheap enrichments → embeddings → clustering → heavy long-form summaries, weighted by UtilityScore and your “priority policy” (e.g., papers > news > social).

Method router (orchestrator). Extend rules so source_type + trust band + user intent select the pipeline:

Fact lookup → hybrid RAG → CRAG grade → maybe expand.

Deep synthesis/nuance → hierarchical summarization + strip-refine + self-consistency.

Trend/timeline → event extraction + timeline pack.

Code repos → code-aware chunking + readme/issue synthesis.

2) Adapters you’ll want (all offline-friendly)

(Each is a small parser that yields Canonical Doc objects and writes to .knowledge/indexes/chunks/ via the existing chunker.)

Reddit saved JSON (we already outlined): posts + top comments, quote harvesting, subreddit/author/time, score.

GitHub repos (local clones or zips): README, docs/, LICENSE, *.md, top *.py/js/ts/go with code-aware chunking; heuristics from .git (commit cadence, stars if present in dump).

Twitter/X exports (zip/JSON): tweets, retweets, likes; author verification flag if present; threads reconstructed.

Discord/Signal exports: threads → conversation turns; per-speaker attribution; timestamps.

Subreddit dumps (Pushshift/JSONL): similar to Reddit saved.

arXiv/academic PDFs: PyMuPDF text; metadata from the dump (title, authors, categories, vN); optional OCR if no text layer.

Hugging Face model pages: model card (README.md), tags, downloads, last update; treat like docs.

Kiwix (ZIM): via libzim python binding; title, URL, text; provenance domain in trust signals.

AcademicTorrents: dataset/paper metadata from the dump; link back for provenance.

Hacker News dumps: item text, points, comments.

News articles (if you have local HTML/Markdown): boilerplate removal → text, domain from URL.

Bluesky (ATProto export): posts/threads like Twitter.

ChatGPT/Gemini transcripts: role-tagged turns; mark as internal notes (low trust externally).

ComfyUI node repos: from list → fetch local READMEs (you supply zip/clone), tag authors/names.

We won’t fetch anything from the web; we only parse your dumps. That keeps it offline and ToS-friendly.

3) Trust bands & utility (how we “believe” and “prioritize”)

TrustScore by source (defaults; you can tune):

Peer-reviewed venue / well-known docs: 0.85–0.95

arXiv/self-published research: 0.65–0.8 (bonus if many versions & citations present in dump)

Major news: 0.55–0.75 (domain allowlist optional)

GitHub READMEs/code: 0.5–0.7 (up with stars/age/consistency)

HN/Reddit/Twitter/Discord: 0.25–0.55

Personal chats/notes: 0.2–0.4

UtilityScore (per doc):
Utility = w1*Novelty + w2*Recency + w3*Engagement + w4*LengthQuality + w5*TopicMatch

Novelty via near-dup detection (MinHash/SimHash) and MMR at assembly time.

Engagement from upvotes/retweets/stars (normalized).

TopicMatch = cosine to your interest profile (optional).

We store bands: High (≥0.7), Medium (0.4–0.7), Low (<0.4), which the orchestrator can use (e.g., avoid low-trust in final unless corroborated).

4) Enrichments that preserve nuance (beyond RAG)

Hierarchical summaries (per-doc → per-cluster → global) with quotes + citations kept.

CRAG “knowledge strips”: sentence/short-span scoring via a local cross-encoder; keep top strips.

Topic clustering (KMeans or Agglomerative) + diversity sampler to avoid echo chambers.

Claim/stance mining (argument structure) for social/news/papers: (claim, support_evidence[], oppose_evidence[]).

Event extraction & timelines for evolving topics.

Dedup/near-dup + novelty sampling.

PII & license guardrails (already in place for PII; add a lightweight license/usage flag for code/repos).

5) How the orchestrator picks methods (examples)

Rules in pipeline.yml:

orchestrator:
  rules:
    - if: intent in ["why","compare","synthesize","opinionated"] or scope=="global"
      then: ["hsum", "crag_refine", "verify"]
    - if: intent in ["fact","where","who"] and good_hits
      then: ["rag_basic","crag_grade"]
    - if: source_mix includes ["news","social"] and question mentions "timeline" or "trend"
      then: ["events","timeline","hsum_cluster"]
    - if: source_type in ["github","code"]
      then: ["code_chunking","hsum_repo","claims_code?"]


Where:

hsum = hierarchical summarization

crag_refine = strip-level recomposition

verify = self-consistency + evidence check

events/timeline = temporal lens

code_chunking = smaller chunks + symbol-aware tagging

6) Packing “single session” mega-contexts (when you want it)

Pack by topic buckets, sorted by Utility × Trust × Novelty, include evidence quotes and source links.

If it won’t fit: multi-session chain — we export N sequential files; each session ends with a state summary the next session consumes. (Export flags: --pack-mode {topic,chronological,claims} --sessions N.)

7) What we add to your repo (small, modular)

New modules:

sources/ — adapters per dump: reddit.py, github.py, twitter.py, discord.py, arxiv.py, zim.py, hn.py, news.py, chats.py, hf.py.

kn/trust.py — TrustScore + domain/venue heuristics; pluggable bands.

kn/prioritizer.py — schedules work by UtilityScore.

kn/topics.py, kn/dedup.py, kn/timeline.py, kn/summary_index.py, kn/crag.py (as planned), kn/orchestrator.py, kn/verify.py.
New plugins:

attributes/doc-summary.py (long-form), attributes/claims.py, attributes/events.py.
New CLIs:

bin/ingest_<source>.py for each adapter,

bin/hsum_build.py, bin/eval_retrieval.py.

Config additions (minimal):

# .knowledge/config/pipeline.yml
sources:
  reddit: { enabled: true }
  github: { enabled: true }
  twitter: { enabled: true }
  # ... others toggled on/off

trust:
  domain_allowlist: []   # optional for news
  arxiv_bonus_per_version: 0.02
  github: { star_breakpoints: [10,100,1000] }

prioritizer:
  weights: { novelty: 0.35, recency: 0.2, engagement: 0.15, length_quality: 0.1, topic: 0.2 }
  max_parallel: 4

packing:
  mode: topic
  sessions: 3
  evidence_quotes: true

8) What changes because of your bigger menu?

Nothing fundamental breaks. We add adapters and trust/utility so the same pipelines (HSum, CRAG, timeline, RAG) operate across heterogeneous sources.

Quality control improves. Low-trust sources don’t dominate final synthesis unless corroborated. High-trust sources get preferential weight.

Throughput stays high. Cheap passes (doc summaries, dedup, embeddings) run first; heavier steps are batched and scheduled.

You keep optionality. Everything remains offline-first, file-system driven, and modular.

If you want, I can generate stubs for the top 4 adapters you’ll hit first (Reddit saved, GitHub repo, Twitter export, arXiv PDFs) and wire Trust/Utility + orchestrator rules so you can drop dumps into a folder and let it churn.

How about capturing and preserving the context of what matters to me (one human user among many potentially) for the various data sources?  e.g. my personal notes, my reddit comments and saved posts, tweets, twitter favorites, etc etc - those are different than the more general data of what's fed in.  though even the general data has somewhat more meaning than anything random due to my selection bias too.  how would this system account for all that, while also being general enough to be able to do the same for more users in the future and/or to make its own objective selections minimizing influence
ChatGPT said:
Thought for 17s

Totally—this is where you add a personalization layer on top of the global GraphRAG/CRAG engine, but keep it switchable so you can run in Personal, Balanced, or Objective modes. Here’s a tight plan that captures your signals, preserves your intent, and stays multi-user friendly.

Goals

Preserve “what matters to me” (saves, likes, comments, notes, chats) as first-class signal.

Stay general so multiple users can coexist later (or the system can run “objective”).

Remain offline-first and modular; everything is explainable & auditable.

Layers (what we add)

User Profile Layer (per user):

A canonical UserEvent log: “I saved/liked/replied/highlighted/read” across Reddit, X, Discord/Signal, GH stars, HN upvotes, notes, etc.

Derived interest embeddings (topic vectors) from your interactions (centroids with time decay).

A light preference schema: topics, sources, styles (e.g., longform, tutorials), recency bias, and “avoid” lists.

Personal Graph Overlay:

Over the global graph, build an ego-graph: nodes and edges you’ve touched, plus nearest neighbors.

Keep weights for “touched by user,” “often co-saved,” “same author/subreddit,” etc.

Scoring & Modes:

Rank items by a transparent formula, then pick a mode:

Score = α·Trust + β·Utility + γ·PersonalRelevance + δ·DiversityBoost − ε·DupPenalty


Personal: γ high (e.g., 0.45), α/β moderate

Balanced: γ moderate (0.2) with stronger diversity

Objective: γ=0; α (trust) and diversity up; also “counter-bias” sampling

Always expose why an item was chosen: top contributing terms, source type, trust band, personal signals.

What to capture (signals)

Normalize everything into a single UserEvent schema (JSONL):

user_id, timestamp, source_type, source_id, event_type, weight,
meta{ subreddit|repo|handle, url, author, title, tags[], device?... }


event_type: saved, upvoted, liked, starred, replied, quoted, highlighted, read_dwell, note_edit

weight: default 1.0; upweight comments you wrote; time-decay older events

We store this per user at:

.knowledge/users/<user_id>/events/events.jsonl

Modeling (simple, effective)

Interest vectors: for each user, maintain one or more centroids (topic clusters) as EMA over embeddings of interacted docs/quotes. Keep:

Global interest vector

Per-domain vectors (reddit, code, papers)

Recency-biased vector for “current focus”

PersonalRelevance(doc) = max cosine(doc_emb, interest_vectors) with decay for stale topics.

DiversityBoost = MMR/novelty w.r.t. what you’ve recently read/seen.

Counter-bias meter: KL divergence between your interest distribution and the corpus distribution; we can surface “areas you under-sample.”

How retrieval & synthesis use it

Two-stage retrieval:

Global hybrid (dense+BM25), then re-rank by PersonalRelevance unless mode=Objective.

If CRAG says “Incorrect/Ambiguous,” expand scope via graph neighbors prioritized by ego-graph proximity (Personal/Balanced) or by trust (Objective).

Context budget allocation:

Personal: allocate, say, 60% budget to high PersonalRelevance across clusters; reserve 40% for high-Trust/novel content.

Balanced: 40/60 split.

Objective: 0/100; plus “anti-filter bubble” slot that forces in counter-examples.

Generation prompts:

Add a persona frame: “Weight sources you have engaged with, but report dissenting high-trust evidence.”

Objective mode prompt removes the persona and asks for “minimize personalization; maximize trust & diversity.”

Multi-user & generality

Per-user dirs:

.knowledge/users/<user_id>/
  profile.yml            # declared prefs (optional)
  events/events.jsonl    # raw interaction log
  vectors/*.npy          # interest vectors (global/domain/recency)
  overlays/ego_graph.*   # user overlay on the global graph
  caches/…               # cached re-ranks & summaries


The global corpus lives as it does now. User overlays don’t mutate it.

Switching users is just switching the user_id in CLI flags or env.

Objective selections (minimize influence)

Mode = Objective:

γ=0; stronger α (Trust) and δ (Diversity).

Disallow user-specific boosts; use domain allowlist and venue priors only.

Report exposure audit: distribution of sources and stances used.

Optionally dual runs: produce personalized and objective answers side-by-side with different evidence packs.

Where it fits in your repo (concrete)

New modules:

kn/profile.py – load/save profile.yml, manage user_id

kn/personalizer.py – compute/update interest vectors; compute PersonalRelevance

kn/ego_graph.py – build/update user overlay graph

kn/trust.py – (already planned) trust bands per source; expose α defaults per mode

kn/orchestrator.py – add mode-aware routing & budget allocation

kn/mmr.py – novelty/diversity utilities

Config additions:

# .knowledge/config/pipeline.yml
users:
  default_user: "me"
  modes: ["personal","balanced","objective"]
  personal:
    alpha: 0.25   # Trust
    beta: 0.25    # Utility
    gamma: 0.45   # PersonalRelevance
    delta: 0.15   # Diversity
  balanced:
    alpha: 0.30
    beta: 0.30
    gamma: 0.20
    delta: 0.25
  objective:
    alpha: 0.45
    beta: 0.35
    gamma: 0.00
    delta: 0.25
  interest:
    decay_half_life_days: 45
    per_domain_vectors: true
    recent_window_days: 14
retrieval_budget:
  personal: { personal_pct: 0.6, trust_pct: 0.4 }
  balanced: { personal_pct: 0.4, trust_pct: 0.6 }
  objective:{ personal_pct: 0.0, trust_pct: 1.0 }


CLI knobs (examples):

# Use my profile in personal mode
python bin/query_rag.py --q "What should I read next about X?" --user me --mode personal

# Balanced synthesis over my Reddit saves + papers
python bin/export_monofile.py --q "State of topic Y" --user me --mode balanced --pack-mode topic

# Objective brief (no personalization) from papers+news only
python bin/export_monofile.py --q "Objective summary of Z" --mode objective --sources papers,news

Privacy & audit

Personal events never leave disk; PII plugin runs on both global and user artifacts.

Every export includes an evidence ledger (sources + why they were included).

Optional encryption-at-rest for .knowledge/users/<user_id> if you want it.

Defaults I’d start with

Half-life 45 days for interest decay; 3 interest vectors (global/domain/recent).

Personal mode: 60/40 budget split; Balanced: 40/60; Objective: 0/100.

Dual-answer option for high-stakes queries: return personalized + objective with evidence lists.

If you like, I can draft the profile.yml format, the UserEvent JSONL schema, and a tiny bin/user_events_import.py (for Reddit saves/Twitter likes/Discord exports) so your profile builds itself the moment you drop those files in.
